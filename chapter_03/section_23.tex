\subsection{Connected Spaces}

\begin{exercise}[ID=3.23.1]
  Let $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ be two topologies on $X$.
  If $\mathcal{T}' \supset \mathcal{T}$, what does connectedness of $X$ in one topology imply about connectedness in the other?
\end{exercise}
%
\begin{solution}
  \textbf{Claim.} If $X$ is connected in the topology $\mathcal{T'}$, then it is connected in the topology $\mathcal{T}$.
  In general, connectedness of $X$ in $\mathcal{T}$ does not imply connectedness of $X$ in $\mathcal{T}'$.
  \begin{proof}
    We proceed by proving the contrapositive.
    Let $X = A \cup B$ be a separation of $X$ in the topology $\mathcal{T}$ so that $X$ is disconnected in this topology.
    By definition of a separation, $A$ and $B$ are open sets in $\mathcal{T}$.
    Since $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$, the sets $A$ and $B$ are also open in $\mathcal{T}'$.
    It follows that they also form a separation of $X$ in the topology $\mathcal{T}'$.
    Thus, $X$ is disconnected also in $\mathcal{T}'$.
    It follows that if $X$ is connected in the topology $\$mathcal{T'}$, then it is connected in the topology $\mathcal{T}$.

    Consider the case where $X$ is a two-point space and let $\mathcal{T}$ be the trivial topology on $X$.
    Since there exists only a single nonempty open set in $\mathcal{T}$, namely $X$, there exists no separation of $X$.
    In the discrete topology $\mathcal{T}'$, however, we have the separation $X = \{a\} \cup \{b\}$ of $X$, where $a \neq b$ are the two elements of $X$.
    Since $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$, it follows that connectedness in one topology does not necessarily imply connectedness in a finer topology.
  \end{proof}

\begin{exercise}[ID=3.23.2]
  Let $\{A_n\}$ be a sequence of connected subspaces of $X$, such that $A_n \cap A_{n+1} \neq \emptyset$ for all $n$.
  Show that $\bigcup A_n$ is connected.
\end{exercise}
%
\begin{solution}
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose by way of contradiction that $\bigcup A_n = U \cap V$ is a separation of $\bigcup A_n$, \ie, $U$ and $V$ are disjoint nonempty open sets whose union is $\bigcup A_n$.
    Since for all $n \in \ZZ_+$, $A_n$ is a subspace of $X$, $\bigcup A_n$ is a subspace of $X$ and $A_n \subset \bigcup A_n$, we have that $A_n$ is a connected subspace of $\bigcup A_n$.
    In particular, $A_1$ is a connected subspace of $\bigcup A_n$.
    By Theorem 2.23.2, that means that $A_1$ must lie entirely within either $U$ or $V$.
    Without loss of generality, assume that $A_1 \subset U$.

    Suppose that $A_n$ sits entirely within $U$ for some $n \in \ZZ_+$.
    As a connected subspace of $\bigcup A_n$, it must be the case that $A_{n+1}$ also lies either entirely within $U$ or $V$.
    Since $A_n \cap A_{n+1} \neq \emptyset$, it must be that $A_{n+1}$ intersects $U$.
    Since $U$ and $V$ are disjoint, this implies that $A_{n+1}$ lies entirely within $U$.
    By induction, we then have that $A_n$ is disjoint from $V$ for all $n \in \ZZ_+$.
    But then $V = V \cap \bigcup A_n = \emptyset$, which contradicts our assumption that $\bigcup A_n$ is not connected.
  \end{proof}

\begin{exercise}[ID=3.23.3]
  Let $\{A_\alpha\}$ be a collection of connected subspaces of $X$;
  let $A$ be a connected subspace of $X$.
  Show that if $A \cap A_\alpha \neq \emptyset$ for all $\alpha$, then $A \cup \left(\bigcup A_\alpha\right)$ is connected.
\end{exercise}
%
\begin{solution}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $\{B_\alpha\}$ be the collection of sets defined by $B_\alpha = A \cup A_\alpha$, for all $\alpha$.
    Since $A \cap A_\alpha \neq \emptyset$, by hypothesis, Theorem 2.23.3 implies that $B_\alpha$ is a connected subspace of $X$ for all $\alpha$.
    By construction, $\bigcap B_\alpha \supset A \neq \emptyset$.
    Thus, by Theorem 2.23.3,
    %
    \begin{equation*}
      \bigcup B_\alpha = \bigcup \left(A \cup A_\alpha\right) = A \cup \left(\bigcup A_\alpha\right)
    \end{equation*}
    %
    is connected.
  \end{proof}
